                    <p>Conceived in 2013, the idea of ‘sweeping the South’ came from a need to improve the quality and efficiency of the domestic services industry in South Africa. It is safe to say that they have done a pretty good job of connecting service providers, aptly named SweepStars, and the rest of us.</p>
                    <p>From an average persona’s point of view, SweepSouth is a mobile application that offers a quick and hassle free way of getting your home cleaned. It is pretty straight forward as we shall see further on in this brief dive of the User Experience.</p>

                <p>Booking a clean on the mobile application was a fairly positive experience as I shall demonstrate below. Take note that at the time of booking, I was already enrolled into the Sweep South database i.e. not a new user. I also received a R300 cleaning voucher for use in this exercise.
                    I have created a simple emoji based scale to showcase my emotions as I go through my journey.

                    As simple as the booking process is, there are couple of areas I would ‘tweak’ to make it a little smoother.

                            Although the components are distinguishable by drop shadows, the blue on white makes it a little difficult to instantly segment the app particularly around the bottom half.</li>
                            <br>
                        <li>Layout: Move the history button.<br>
                            It does seem intuitive to put the two buttons ‘booking’ and ‘history’ next to each other. However, we could make better use of the space on the top right and eliminate the very likely scenario of hitting the wrong button when attempting to book a clean or view the history.</li>

                    These changes are cosmetic at best therefore a simple “go ahead” will suffice.</p>

                        1. GPS Usage: Devices<br><br>
                        Asking for directions is recurring theme on the day of the appointment. What I realise is that the SweepStars either neglect to use GPS or perhaps their devices are limited somehow (mobile data, etc...). I believe some emphasis on this GPS usage would benefit the service. An extreme recommendation would be providing dedicated work devices.

                        2. GPS Usage: Geolocation<br><br>
                        Locate the SweepStar in real time and automatically update their arrival via geolocation and not via a button in their version of the app. In my most recent experience, I waited 23 minutes for the SweepStar to arrive after their status had been updated to ‘Arrived’ from ‘En Route’.

                Implementing a new feature or an update can be a very complicated procedure if its not handled very well. I will illustrate, very simply, how I would roll out the UI update.

                <p>
                    Sweep South has come a long way since its beginning and they have a long way to go still. This definitely excites me because so far, it is quite good. The technology recommendations in my report were just but a few of many little pickings I have with the current application and mobile applications in general.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When rolling out a new feature or an update, there definitely isn’t a “one side fits all” approach. Everything requires its own set of rules and resources that allow us to build new features with the least number of complications and procedures.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Overall, I have always enjoyed using the SweepSouth service and that will probably remain the same for me for as long as they are around to pick up my call.
